        <li>Built with Three.js, using optimised architectural models that were decimated prior to integration to maintain performance</li>
        <li>Implemented layer-based visualisation by grouping meshes, allowing users to toggle different development plans on and off</li>
        <li>Created a data-driven node system using JSON to display contextual information about buildings and development areas</li>
        <li>Delivered the project under a tight multi-week deadline, focusing on clarity, performance, and reliability</li>
