    <p><a href="https://seeingmachines.com/" target="_blank">Seeing Machines</a> is a corporate WordPress website built to reflect the client's cutting-edge, technology-driven brand. A key requirement was a distinctive, “futuristic” homepage feature that visually reinforced the company's work in advanced machine vision and safety systems.</p>
    <p class="bold underline">Technical Highlights:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Built as a custom WordPress theme using ACF to manage structured content throughout the site</li>
        <li>Developed a Three.js hero banner, loading a 3D model with a custom shader that tracks mouse or gyroscopic movement</li>
        <li>Balanced visual complexity with performance considerations to ensure smooth behaviour across desktop and mobile browsers</li>
    </ul>
