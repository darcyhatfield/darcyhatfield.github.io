    <p><a href="https://railsafetyweek.com.au/" target="_blank">Tracksville Trivia</a> is an interactive trivia experience for children, created as part of Rail Safety Week. The experience presents trivia questions within a playful 3D isometric environment, encouraging exploration and repeat engagement.</p>
    <p class="bold underline">Technical Highlights:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Built using Three.js, creating a 3D isometric scene populated with interactive nodes representing trivia locations</li>
        <li>Implemented a data-driven node system powered by JSON, allowing trivia locations and states to be managed independently of scene logic</li>
        <li>Integrated with a custom trivia API, consuming question data and tracking progress as users moved through the experience</li>
        <li>Managed scene state, visually updating nodes once questions had been answered</li>
    </ul>
