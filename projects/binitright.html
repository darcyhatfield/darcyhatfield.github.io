    <p>Bin It Right is an educational mobile game developed for Campbelltown City Council to help teach children proper recycling habits through play. Rising contamination levels in local recycling bins meant the council needed an engaging, interactive way to educate young residents and their families about what belongs in each waste stream.</p>
    <p>The game blends fun sorting mechanics with a light metagame, rewarding players for correct recycling and encouraging repeat play at to unlock new levels and rewards. Built for both Android and iOS, the final experience is bright, energetic, and built around real-world behavioural outcomes, giving the council a measurable tool to support better waste-sorting habits across the community.</p>
    <p class="bold underline">Technical Highlights:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Built in Unity using an event-driven architecture, implementing multiple gameplay systems including sorting mechanics, vehicle-based collection loops, and progression logic</li>
        <li>Implemented a Firebase Analytics pipeline, batching gameplay events and forwarding data to Google Analytics for easy client reporting and analysis</li>
        <li>Designed a custom analytics schema to track incorrect sorting by item type and age group, enabling targeted educational messaging</li>
        <li>Navigated iOS build constraints without direct device access, integrating a specialised build workflow to successfully deliver iOS builds</li>
    </ul>
