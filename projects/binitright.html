    <p>Bin It Right is an educational mobile game developed for Campbelltown City Council to help teach children proper recycling habits through play. Rising contamination levels in local recycling bins meant the council needed an engaging, interactive way to educate young residents—and their families—about what belongs in each waste stream.</p>
    <p>The game blends fun sorting mechanics with a light metagame, rewarding players for correct recycling and encouraging repeat play at to unlock new levels and rewards. Built for both Android and iOS, the final experience is bright, energetic, and built around real-world behavioural outcomes, giving the council a measurable tool to support better waste-sorting habits across the community.</p>
