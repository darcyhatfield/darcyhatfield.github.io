    <p>Double Shot is a high-energy VR action bartending game created by Aberrant Realities, blending over-the-top 80s flair with fast-paced drink mixing and chaotic combat. Set in a neon-soaked alternate timeline where gangs rule the streets, players step into the shoes of a battle-hardened bartender tasked with serving drinks, taking down enemies, and protecting their sentient bar assistant—all at the same time.</p>
    <p>Developed by a small team, the game combines physics-driven interactions, expressive VR motion, and an arcade-inspired progression system. The project explored how immersive mechanics, characterful worldbuilding, and responsive VR gameplay can come together to create a unique, personality-filled experience.</p>
    <p>Double Shot was a showcase winner in the <a href="https://aus.paxsite.com/en-us/features/indie-showcase/archive.html#double-shot" target="_blank">PAX Aus Indie Showcase</a> in 2018.</p>
