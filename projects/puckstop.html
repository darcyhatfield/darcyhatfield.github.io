    <p>Puck Stop is a VR ice hockey goalkeeping game built for a local media agency as part of the Canberra Brave's promotional and community events. Designed for quick, repeatable play sessions, the experience challenges players to defend the net against an escalating barrage of pucks while competing for top scores.</p>
    <p>The project focused on delivering a fun, intuitive, event-ready VR experience that could be played by anyone. With responsive puck physics, clear feedback, and a simple onboarding flow, Puck Stop became an engaging attraction for sporting events, activations, and public demonstrations.</p>
