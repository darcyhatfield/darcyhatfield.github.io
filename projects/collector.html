    <p>Collector History Walk is a location-based AR “time capsule” app built for the Collector and District Historical Association. The goal of the project was to bring local history to life by letting users stand in key locations and view the town as it once looked—overlaying archival photographs directly onto the landscape through their phone's camera.</p>
    <p>Designed for outdoor use, the app guides visitors via a map to specific historical points of interest. Once there, they can see long-lost buildings and scenes restored in context, giving a deeper appreciation of the region's past. A combination of on-site testing, performance tuning, and iterative UX refinement ensured the AR alignment felt as immersive and accurate as possible.</p>
    <p class="bold underline">Technical Highlights:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Built using Unity with the Wikitude AR SDK, leveraging video-based point cloud tracking for image-aligned AR experiences</li>
        <li>Adapted mid-project to the announced sunsetting of Wikitude, working within its remaining lifecycle to deliver a stable final product</li>
        <li>Integrated Mapbox for GPS-based map navigation, guiding users to historical points of interest</li>
        <li>Conducted extensive on-site testing and calibration to fine-tune AR alignment, tracking stability, and user flow in outdoor conditions</li>
    </ul>
