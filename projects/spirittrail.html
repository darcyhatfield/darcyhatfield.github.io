    <p>Spirit Trail is a match-3 battle game built for the Playdate, inspired by Japanese folklore and designed around fast, tactical decision-making. Players match tiles to battle a lineup of 8 yōkai, each with their own unique abilities and attacks. Spirit Trail encourages players to learn enemy behaviours and optimise their team as they uncover the stories of the yōkai they defeat. </p>
    <p>My main goal when starting development of Spirit Trail was to push my pixel art skills from what I had done for my previous games. I am really proud of the art I produced for the game and how far my pixel art skills have come from the beginning of the project to the release.</p>
