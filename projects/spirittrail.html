    <p>Spirit Trail is a match-3 battle game built for the Playdate, inspired by Japanese folklore. Players swap tiles to trigger attacks against eight unique yōkai, each with distinct behaviours and combat patterns. The game encourages players to learn enemy mechanics, optimise their team, and progress by unlocking lore entries in a codex after each victory.</p>
    <p>My main goal when starting development of Spirit Trail was to push my pixel art skills from what I had done for my previous games. I am really proud of the art I produced for the game and how far my pixel art has come from the beginning of the project to the release.</p>
    <p class="bold underline">Technical Highlights:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Built entirely solo with the Playdate SDK, created a custom match-3 system from scratch using a grid-based array to represent the board state</li>
        <li>Implemented a class-based inheritance hierarchy for heroes and yōkai, centralising shared combat logic in a base class while allowing subclasses to override specific behaviour methods for abilities and attacks</li>
        <li>Focused heavily on performance optimisation, including tile pooling and manual memory management to maintain smooth gameplay on the Playdate's constrained hardware</li>
        <li>Implemented all gameplay, rendering, audio, and state management without external tooling, working directly within the lightweight SDK</li>
    </ul>
