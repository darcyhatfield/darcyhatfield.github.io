    <p>Clash Cards is a turn-based card battler for the Playdate, inspired by <i>Tetra Master</i> from <i>Final Fantasy IX</i>. Players compete for control of a grid by placing cards that attack in cardinal directions. The game features quickplay matches, a pass-n-play two player mode and a roguelite-style draft mode for replayability.</p>
    <p>Developed entirely solo, Clash Cards was my first major project while learning the Playdate SDK, and it became a hands-on way to understand what works well on the device figure out workflow that worked well for me. The project helped me explore the Playdate's unique constraints, experiment with efficient rendering and refine gameplay systems to suit it's minimalist hardware.</p>
    <p class="bold underline">Technical Highlights:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Implemented a grid-based card combat system, where card interactions are determined by cardinal adjacency</li>
        <li>Defined all cards using JSON data, allowing new cards and balance changes to be added without modifying game logic</li>
        <li>Built a card image caching system to preload and reuse card assets, significantly improving performance and load times</li>
        <li>Used the project as a deep dive into the Playdate SDK, refining workflows and adapting Unity-style patterns to better suit the device's constraints</li>
    </ul>
