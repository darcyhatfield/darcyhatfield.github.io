    <p>Block Buster is a fast-paced, grid-based tetronimo game built for the Playdate, focused on speed, precision, and escalating pressure. Players race to place blocks on a 5x5 grid, clear lines, and survive increasingly frantic challenges across modes such as Classic, Escalation, Time Attack and Countdown.</p>
    <p>The project was intentionally developed with a “build fast, release fast” approach - I took the game from concept to a published Playdate Catalog release within just a few months in my spare time. Handling all of the programming, design and art, I focused on tight responsiveness, a punchy feedback loop, and a minimalist aesthetic that complements the Playdate's hardware.</p>
