    <p>A collection of short-form promotional web games for a bottle shop marketing campaign. The games were designed to be quick to play, easy to understand, and engaging across a wide audience, making them well suited for promotional use.</p>
    <p>Each game was developed to tie into specific seasonal events and campaigns, including the Australian Open, Easter, and the NRL Grand Final. This required rapid concept development and fast iteration to ensure each game aligned with the theme, timing, and promotional goals of the campaign.</p>
    <p>All six games were built under very tight development timelines, focusing on delivering polished, reliable experiences that could be launched quickly and reused across multiple platforms, including mobile phones, tablets, and desktop browsers.</p>
    <p class="bold underline">Technical Highlights:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Developed six short-form promotional games using Phaser, HTML, and JavaScript, creating a shared game framework to handle common systems and significantly reduce development time across each release</li>
        <li>Integrated directly with the client's API, decoding incoming authentication tokens to extract player and game data</li>
        <li>Generated and returned signed tokens containing gameplay outcomes and prize data to ensure secure, tamper-resistant communication</li>
        <li>Optimised all games for mobile-first performance, while maintaining compatibility across phones, tablets, and desktop browsers</li>
    </ul>
