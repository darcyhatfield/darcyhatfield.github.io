    <p>Quest (working title) is a solo-developed turn-based roguelike game, inspired by the game loop of Slay the Spire and the rhythm-based combat mechanics of The Legend of Dragoon, a JRPG I adored as a kid. The project aimed to combine thoughtful, sequential decision-making with timing-based action inputs to create a combat system that felt both tactical and engaging.</p>
    <p>Over the course of development, I built many of the core gameplay systems - enemy AI, player abilities, turn sequencing, stat scaling, world progression, and the timing-based combat interactions that served as the heart of the experience. Ultimately, the scope of the required art and animation surpassed what I could manage on my own at the time, and I chose to shelve the project.</p>
    <p>Despite not reaching full release, Quest became a major learning milestone, giving me deeper insight into designing layered RPG systems, balancing turn-based mechanics, structuring game architecture in Unity, and understanding how scope impacts solo development. I remain proud of the combat prototype and the systems groundwork the project established.</p>
