    <p>Build the Train is an interactive touchscreen experience created for Downer Group's Queensland Train Manufacturing Program Visitor Centre. The installation needed to appeal to visitors of all ages - many of whom would only interact with it once - so the focus was on designing an immediate, intuitive, and educational hands-on activity.</p>
    <p>Players assemble a train by rotating and aligning key components into place, learning about the rail manufacturing process and parts as they play. The experience is deliberately short, visually bold, and easy to grasp, making it ideal for high-traffic event-style usage while still communicating meaningful information about the QTMP program.</p>
    <p class="bold underline">Technical Highlights:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Developed in Unity for a Windows-based kiosk setup, targeting a large-format touchscreen display</li>
        <li>Designed a tolerance-based snapping system, calculating rotational thresholds to score accuracy and provide feedback based on proximity to the correct alignment</li>
        <li>Built the experience to be robust and self-contained, optimised for continuous public use in a high-traffic environment</li>
    </ul>
