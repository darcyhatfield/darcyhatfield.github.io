                        <p>I am a web and interactive developer with 8+ years of experience building modern websites and custom digital experiences. My primary focus is on developing clean, responsive, and maintainable web solutions, with a strong background in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and WordPress. I enjoy building systems that are flexible, intuitive to use, and tailored to real client needs.</p>
                        <p>Alongside my web work, I have extensive experience developing interactive applications and games in Unity, with shipped projects across desktop, mobile, VR, and AR. This background strongly informs how I approach interaction design, performance, and system architecture on the web - allowing me to build richer, more engaging experiences than traditional content-only sites.</p>
                        <p>I have experience working with Three.js on smaller interactive web projects, exploring 3D interaction and animation in browser-based environments. I also develop games for the Playdate handheld console, with three titles released on the curated Playdate Store, giving me hands-on experience designing within tight technical and creative constraints.</p>
                        <p>Whether working independently or as part of a team, I enjoy taking ideas from early concept through to polished, user-focused digital experiences. I'm driven by problem-solving, clarity of design, and creating work that's both enjoyable to use and well-crafted under the hood.</p>
