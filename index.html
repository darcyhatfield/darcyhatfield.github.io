                    <div class="about-content">
                        <p>I am a Unity and web developer with 8+ years of experience creating games and interactive digital experiences across desktop, VR, AR, mobile, and the web. I specialise in building polished gameplay systems, exploring unique mechanics, and refining game feel—supported by strong C# fundamentals, a deep understanding of game design principles, and a passion for thoughtful interaction design.</p>
                        <p>Beyond game development, I also build modern, responsive WordPress websites, crafting custom themes, interactive features, and tailored client solutions. I've also worked with Three.js on smaller interactive web projects, expanding my ability to deliver engaging experiences across both 2D and 3D environments.</p>
                        <p>Alongside my professional Unity and web work, I also develop games for the Playdate handheld console, with three titles released on the curated Playdate store. I love the challenge of designing for unconventional hardware and finding creative ways to deliver satisfying gameplay within tight constraints.</p>
                        <p>Whether collaborating with a creative team or working independently, I enjoy taking ideas from early concept through to polished, memorable interactive experiences. I'm driven by curiosity, clarity of design, and the joy of making things that feel good to play and satisfying to use.</p>
